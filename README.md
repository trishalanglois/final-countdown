## Project Requirements

This project was completed by [Trisha Langlois](https://github.com/trishalanglois) over the course of four days as a final graduation requirement at Turing School of Software and Design.  The purpose of the project was to build an app in Vue, a framework in which I had no prior experience.  [Project requirements can be found here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/final-countdown.html), and my [Trello project board with user stories can be found here](https://trello.com/b/Qh6id7HL/final-countdown).
